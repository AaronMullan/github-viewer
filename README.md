#Github Viewer#

A deploy of this site can be seen at: https://github-viewer-nine.vercel.app/

Basic site demonstrating use of the Github API via GraphQL. Made with NextJS 13 (App router), Apollo Client, Tailwind CSS, and Typescript.

The user detail page is as agnostic as possible by using a query param to store the user name. This way any valid username can be added to the params on the user detail page; the page is not limited to displaying info for the users shown on the home page.

Threw a couple tests in there just for kicks.
